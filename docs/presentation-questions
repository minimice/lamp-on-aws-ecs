Q: Can the load balancer be placed in the private subnet?
A: No, the internet facing ALB must be placed in a public subnet as it serves as the entry point when the client initiates a connection through the internet. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54871524/elastic-load-balancer-pointing-at-private-subnet
and https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/public-load-balancer-private-ec2/

Q: RTO and RPO
A: For RDS Single-AZ, this can vary from minutes to hours with regards to RTO.  RPO for RDS Single-AZ is typically 5 minutes.
See https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-rds-under-the-hood-single-az-instance-recovery/  The RDS SLA currently specified a 99.95% uptime, at https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sla/
RTO for the current architecture will only take a few minutes to deploy in another region, this can be set to virtually 0 by having an active-active deployment.

Q: RDS read replica to another region, e.g. Japan is this sync or asynchronous?
A: This is asychronous.  See https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/read-replicas/

Q: Does code commit work with IAM roles?
A: Yes it does!  See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html

Q: How does AWS mitigate against DDoS attacks?
A: I mentioned the ALB before, it also supports AWS WAF, and AWS shield.  A list of best practises is available at  https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-ddos-attack-mitigation/ and more information about AWS shield at https://aws.amazon.com/shield/
